## Data Sets For Hub Location Problems

This repository contains the following data sets for hub location problems used in the paper "A branch-and-Benders-cut approach for the r-allocation p-hub maximal covering problem with binary and partial coverage criteria": CAB, AP25, AP50 and AP75

CAB data set follows the following format:

Number of vertices
Flow matrix
Distance matrix

AP25, AP50 and AP50 data sets follow the following format:

Number of vertices
Vertices coordinates
Flow matrix
